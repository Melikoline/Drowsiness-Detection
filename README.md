# Drowsiness-Detection
<p style="text-align:justify">
Driver drowsiness detection is a crucial car safety technology that aims to prevent accidents caused by drivers becoming drowsy. In this project, the MRL eye dataset was utilized to process images for a model. The code employs computer vision to monitor the driver's face, utilizing either a built-in camera or mobile devices. When signs of driver fatigue or drowsiness are detected, the system promptly alerts the driver in order to prevent potential accidents.
